I watched the Painted Veil again tonight. I'm always amazed by the quality of the story and the dialogue: while I understand that it's an adaptation of a classic novel, I am nevertheless continually astonished that such a good movie should ever have been released. There is just such a wealth of wonderful points about the subtler parts of love, affection and betrayal:

<blockquote>
<p>Do you know what I find strange? That your husband should never look at you. He looks at the walls, the floor, his shoes...</p>

<small>The Painted Veil</small>
