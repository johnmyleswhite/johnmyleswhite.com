Never trust someone who does not cry. Even pious Aeneas cried, albeit only in secret. A man who does not cry is trying too hard to suppress the feelings all sane men have; in not crying, he is killing his heart a little day by day in the fool's hope of escaping from the pains flesh is heir to. To live honestly, one must submit to grief and accept it, endure it and suffer it until its course is run.
