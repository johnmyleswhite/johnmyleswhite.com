Dear Supreme Court,

Please do not [end the Exclusionary Rule](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/opinion/16mon4.html?_r=1&th&emc=th). We *do not* need to encourage the police to disregard [the constitutional requirement for warrants.](http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html)

Thank you.
