<blockquote>
<p>Conan: I remember days like this, when my father took me to the forest. We ate wild blueberries... more than twenty years ago. I was just a boy of four or five. The leaves were so dark and green then. The grass smelled sweet with the spring wind...</p>

<p>Almost twenty years of pitiless combat! No rest -- no sleep like other men! And yet, the spring wind blows, Subotai. Have you ever felt such a wind?</p>

<p>Subotai: They blow where I live too -- in the north of every man's heart.</p>
 
<p>Conan: It's never too late, Subotai.</p>
 
<p>Subotai: No... It would only lead me back here another day -- in even worse company.</p>

<p>Conan: For us, there is no spring. Just the wind that smells fresh before the storm.</p>

After a workweek of almost eighty hours, I can smile at the irony that a quotation from Conan the Barbarian seems to best sum up my life lately.
