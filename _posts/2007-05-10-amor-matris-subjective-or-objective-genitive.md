Without a doubt, the worst of the horrors in this life is the absolute pointlessness of evil -- that suffering is only rarely caused by cruel men who delight in the miseries of others, that evil is generally done instead by men who are weak and confused, afraid and fragile, who feel compelled to make the decision to put their own happiness before that of others, to sacrifice others after having come to see that if it must be one's own happiness or the happiness of another, one must choose one's own to survive -- nevermind thrive.

It is still not clear after all this why love is made an ideal? In love alone, in Joycean love that is, one passionately desires the happiness of another being as strongly as one's own. It is a rare moment in which we find that morality is made real on Earth: that one is as little selfish as is required to be happy and no more.

And knowing all this, how can we not understand the appeal of Christianity -- its simple charm? Christianity is the dream -- the false promise -- that the world can be filled with that simple love that every mother has for her child, every man united to all others, the true dissolution of the *principium individuationis*. But this is only hidden underneath layers of vindictiveness and rage, the eternal hatred that built the gates of Hell.

In contrast to all this, there is de Sade's charm: his world is simple and comprehensible; it replaces the childish dualism of traditional morality with a simple affirmation that there is only selfishness and nothing else in the world. Everyone is a monster, and therefore you must be a monster if you will not be everyone's victim. Virtue is pointless and does nothing: being virtuous, you will live in misery and die in defeat, having improved nothing and made no difference.

The antithesis of it all? The moral vision of Shakespearean tragedy, above all. But every truly great artist from Dostoevsky to Herbert represents this realization about morality -- one that no philosopher has matched thus far.
