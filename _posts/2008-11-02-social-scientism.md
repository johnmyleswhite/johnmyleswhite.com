I find extraordinary the readiness with which members of certain branches of the social sciences latch onto obscure and irrelevant findings in the natural sciences as means of buttressing their views. This habit convinces me that their work is, as Hayek would say, merely scientistic -- that their life's work is the application of a whitewash of scientific terminology to what is merely an exposition of their moral convictions.
