<blockquote>
<p>I've just come back from the war.<br />
I'm angry and tired and bored,<br />
Scarred by the things that I saw.<br />
Still don't feel like I'm home.</p>

<p>Don't wanna go back,<br />
But I don't wanna stay.<br />
I'm still waiting for<br />
The big parade.</p>

<p>Just before dawn<br />
Doesn't feel like last fall.<br />
Feels like a friend I've lost touch with<br />
Who I hoped wouldn't call.</p>

<p>Blankets and clothes,<br />
Pictures of wives,<br />
The glow in the burning<br />
We saw from the sky.</p>

<p>When I woke up,<br />
All swaddled in white,<br />
I wanted my mother,<br />
Wanted her to tell me why I was alive.</p>

<p>I'd write every night<br />
Just before bed.<br />
For a while there I stopped.<br />
Did you think I was dead?</p>

<p>The truth of it is<br />
I was just scared --<br />
Scared to come back;<br />
I wanted to stay.</p>

<p>I'm still still waiting<br />
For the big parade.</p>

<p>Don't wanna go back.<br />
Don't wanna stay...</p>

<p>I'm still waiting,<br />
Still waiting for<br />
The big parade.</p>

This song always strikes me as the most beautiful of the songs by Jonah Matranga.
