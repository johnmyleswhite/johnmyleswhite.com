A friend just referenced a recent New York Times op-ed entitled, [Herbert Hoover Lives](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/opinion/01rich.html?_r=1). I agree with very little of the content of the op-ed, but thought it was worth reading if only because reading it made clear to me why I have so little patience for either of our two major American political parties: both of them systematically exploit the misfortunes of many Americans to justify the policies they were unable to implement during better days. The Democrats are currently exploiting our economic suffering to push through legislation of dubious economic value; this parallels the Republicans' attacks on civil liberties in the wake of 9/11. The only relevant difference -- and the reason I ultimately prefer the Democrats to the Republicans -- is that the Democrats' policies strike me as simply unwise, while the Republican policies often struck me as plainly immoral.
