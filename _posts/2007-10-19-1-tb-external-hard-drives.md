I just received my new 1 TB external hard drive in the mail. It cost $330 dollars.

Looking at it, I realized that I am old enough that the hard drive I now use with my computer is more than 10,000 times larger than the hard drive in the first computer I had as a child.

If only there were but one other area of human activity in which things were 10,000 times better than they were when I was born.
