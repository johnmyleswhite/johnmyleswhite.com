[A recent post](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2008/07/nyt_vs_wsj_on_g.html) on the [Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science blog](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype) provides an especially clear example of media bias: the New York Times uses [an article recently published in Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/321/5888/494) to support the traditionally liberal view of gender differences as created by social injustices, while the Wall Street Journal uses the same research to support the traditionally conservative view that they are products of human nature.

As someone points out in the comments, the problem is quite simple: many newspapers refuse to discuss variance and only interest themselves in means.
