It is fascinating the way that small ticks can tell us so much about a human being's personality.

While the person may master keeping control of most outward signs, their hands or their faces often betray them.

For instance, I have found that all of those with a certain sort of paranoid obsessive personality share a tendency to move their hands in the same repetitive way: there is a constant rubbing together of fingers whenever they feel threatened. In one individual, this action is so constant that the skin is constantly raw and often torn to the point of bleeding.

In those affected by Tourette's, the repetitive movements tend rather to involve the face and mouth. Particularly I have found that lipsmacking or the repetitive rubbing together of the lips is the strongest sign of Tourette's.

Whether such behavior neurologically is interpreted as subtly rewarding (as in the case of ADHD behavior) or is simply the result of a closed loop of activation that indefinitely repeats under certain circumstances (i.e. outward stress) is unclear.

Regardless, it is amazing how much we can learn about the mental traits of others from seemingly small nuances of their physical behavior.
