Somehow, by some quirk of inattention, this poem, which set my literary life in motion, has never been put down here.

<blockquote>
<p>From childhood's hour I have not been<br />
As others were — I have not seen<br />
As others saw — I could not bring<br />
My passions from a common spring —<br />
From the same source I have not taken<br />
My sorrow — I could not awaken<br />
My heart to joy at the same tone —<br />
And all I lov''d — I lov'd alone —<br />
Then — in my childhood — in the dawn<br />
Of a most stormy life — was drawn<br />
From ev'ry depth of good and ill<br />
The mystery which binds me still —<br />
From the torrent, or the fountain —<br />
From the red cliff of the mountain —<br />
From the sun that 'round me roll'd<br />
In its autumn tint of gold —<br />
From the lightning in the sky<br />
As it pass'd me flying by —<br />
From the thunder, and the storm —<br />
And the cloud that took the form<br />
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)<br />
Of a demon in my view -</p>

<small>Edgar Allen Poe : Alone</small>
