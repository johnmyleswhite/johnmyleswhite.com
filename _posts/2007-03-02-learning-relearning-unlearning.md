It is far easier to learn something new if it is utterly unexpected than to learn something that contradicts what we already know. Moreso on an unconscious level than on conscious one, our brain rejects contradictions and old patterns play out again while we attempt to perform new ones, making the new ones so difficult to master. We try to speak a foreign language and our own comes out; we try to explore new rhythms as musicians and produce old ones; we look for innovative metaphors and find ourselves using the standard clich√©s.

Yet, in contrast to this sort of learning, which implies either unlearning or increasing the specificity of learned behavior, nothing is easier than relearning. What was learned once is always hidden somewhere in the brain, like Lovecraft's Cthulhu.

<blockquote>
<p>That is not dead which can eternal lie,<br />
And after strange aeons even death may die.</p>

<small>H.P. Lovecraft : The Call Of Cthulhu</small>
</blockquote>

In this too, we can see the image of our brain's most basic level of functioning.
