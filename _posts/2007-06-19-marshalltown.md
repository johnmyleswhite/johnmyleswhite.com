Is it more cause for despair to live as a farmer's son in a valley in Austria, surrounded by mountains that seem unsurpassable, or on the plains of Iowa, surrounded by endless distances in all directions?

Iowa is worse: the mountains in Austria, though threatening, at least extend the hope that the world beyond them is different from the world in which one lives. In Iowa there is only an infinite sameness in all directions and no hope for escape.
