<blockquote>
<p>The best way to explain why dishonest men, sometimes even fools, almost always have greater success in society than the honest and intelligent is that they find it easier to adapt, since, generally speaking, society is both dishonest and foolish; honest, sensible people find it difficult to come to terms with this so quickly and waste valuable time before they can hope to succeed. The former are like merchants who speak the language of the country and can start trading straight away, whereas the latter are forced to learn the speech of their suppliers and clients. Before setting up shop and starting business, they often can't even be bothered and leave without making a single deal.</p>

Perhaps it is all an illusion, but that feeling of existential loneliness I so often have always leaves as soon as I open the pages of the works of Chamfort or La Rochefoucauld.

<blockquote>
<p>Nous avons plus de force que de volonté; et c'est souvent pour nous excuser à nous-mêmes que nous nous imaginons que les choses sont impossibles.</p>

<small>François Duc De La Rochefoucauld : Maximes : XXX</small>
