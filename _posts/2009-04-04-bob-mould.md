I am incredibly glad to have found out tonight that Bob Mould, the guitarist for the classic punk band Hüsker Dü, is writing pop rock songs and touring in support of a new record. The picture he has of himself on [his Myspace page](http://www.myspace.com/bobmould) is enough to make me believe in rock music again.
