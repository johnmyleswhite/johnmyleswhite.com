Since I posted a little while ago about the [recent PLoS One article on chimpanzee prostitution](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pone.0005116), I thought that I should show that I am no speciesist by reminding us all that human prostitution is alive in just those forms we see among the chimpanzees. These two articles I read today should serve as case studies in the inability of humans to love sanely.
