<p>I've held onto old codes of honor like the captain to a sinking ship. The world moved on and rolled its eyes, but there are some things that are worse than dying. It's always been my way to over-romanticize, cuz' when I was young I had a hard time with what was real and fantasized. The world moved on and did its thing, and I tried and I tried, but could not stop being that boy. And nothing turned out quite like they told me. I will believe in dragons for as long as I run with dragons, while these bodies keep piling, but there are some things that are worse than dying.</p>

Plainly, an appreciation for hardcore as a musical genre and for Bane's lyrics in particular are acquired tastes, but I feel compelled to praise Bane for continuing to be, in my opinion, the most genuine band that exists in the modern world. Thank you, Bane, for being so beautifully real, with all of your faults, weaknesses and uglinesses right upfront, beside your unrivaled passion and sincerity.
