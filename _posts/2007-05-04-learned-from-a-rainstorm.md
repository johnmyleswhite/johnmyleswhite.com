<blockquote>
<p>There is something to be learned from a rainstorm. When meeting with a sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road. But doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still get wet. When you are resolved from the beginning, you will not be perplexed, though you still get the same soaking. This understanding extends to everything.</p>

<small>Yamamoto Tsunetomo : Hagakure : Chapter 1</small>

This passage, which I have always loved, has come to mind quite often lately. How I wish I knew where my copy of Ghost Dog was.
