The Germans' recent reaction to Günter Grass is derisorily ironic, because, in its quest to atone for its past, Germany is simply writing a new chapter of the saga of its broken psychology, the story of nation with a perverse nature that leaves it feeling a constant need to scapegoat a subset of its population for the failures of the entire society, to enforce new fashions as absolute moral rules and to burn all heretics and witches. The Germans are the masters of ostracism and the basic crime is the same, whether in the name of Nazism or of anti-Nazism.
