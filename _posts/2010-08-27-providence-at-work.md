In August 2008, I commented on [the remarkable incompetence of Blockbuster's CEO](http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2008/08/20/no-one-will-ever-want-a-personal-computer/). Now, in August 2010, it seems that we're about to [watch Blockbuster announce bankruptcy](http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/27/blockbuster-filing-for-bankruptcy-next-month-probably/).

It's extraordinary how just the world can be at times.
