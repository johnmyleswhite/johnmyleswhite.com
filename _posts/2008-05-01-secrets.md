Sharing secrets is almost always a mistake, because those to whom you reveal your secrets will get more pleasure out of revealing them to others than they will suffer from the secrets becoming common knowledge. Honor and loyalty are not the central forces at work; it is simply a matter of dissimilar incentives. Just as others will not spontaneously take it upon themselves to clean your dishes for you, they will not keep your secrets simply because you have asked them to.

One should always bear in mind what the Italians say: "a secret is a rumor that spreads one person at a time."
