For the past few weeks I've been reading George Orwell's journals, which are being posted [here](http://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/) as if they were the entries of a blog. Generally, I've been disappointed: Orwell's fascination with details leads to short entries that, by and large, only contain his descriptions of mundane objects like the farm animals he had encountered that day. For that reason, I was quite impressed by today's bit about his first trip to Gibraltar. Particularly the following line:

<blockquote>
<p>Standard of living apparently not very low, no barefooted adults and few children.</p>

<small>George Orwell : Journals : 7.9.38</small>
</blockquote>

It strikes me as a very interesting characterization of the standard of living of a nation. You can read the rest of it [here](http://orwelldiaries.wordpress.com/2008/09/07/gibraltar-7938/).
