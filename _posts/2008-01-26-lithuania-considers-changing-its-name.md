[The nation of Lithuania is considering changing its name](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22841519/?GT1=10755)

I have not seen many better examples lately of a proposal to make a costly change that will ultimately prove irrelevant. It will do Lithuania no good to be named differently if most Americans cannot locate it or its neighbors, such as Estonia or Latvia, on a map. Americans are indifferent to Lithuania not simply because of its name.
