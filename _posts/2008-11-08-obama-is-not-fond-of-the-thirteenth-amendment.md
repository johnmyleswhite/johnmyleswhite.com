Evidently, Barack Obama still intends to impose involuntary servitude upon our nation's youth. To quote Obama's new website, [Change.gov](http://change.gov):

<blockquote>
<p>The Obama Administration will call on Americans to serve in order to meet the nation's challenges. President-Elect Obama will expand national service programs like AmeriCorps and Peace Corps and will create a new Classroom Corps to help teachers in underserved schools, as well as a new Health Corps, Clean Energy Corps, and Veterans Corps. Obama will call on citizens of all ages to serve America, by developing a plan to require 50 hours of community service in middle school and high school and 100 hours of community service in college every year. Obama will encourage retiring Americans to serve by improving programs available for individuals over age 55, while at the same time promoting youth programs such as Youth Build and Head Start.</p>

Fortunately for those of us troubled by this scheme, it seems like that it won't take very long for the Supreme Court to rule that such a proposal violates the 13th Amendment, which reads,

<blockquote>
<p>Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.</p>

There is, of course, one solution to the daunting problem the Constitution creates for Obama: we can simply make it a crime to be a teenager. Who likes that idea?
