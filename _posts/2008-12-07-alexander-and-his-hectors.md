I suspect that anyone with an interest in evolutionary psychology or game theory will enjoy this passage from Taleb's "The Black Swan:"

<blockquote>
<p>I discovered that it is much more effective to act like a nice guy and be "reasonable" if you prove willing to go beyond just verbiage. You can afford to be compassionate, lax, and courteous if, once in a while, when it is least expected of you, but completely justified, you sue someone, or savage an enemy, just to show that you can walk the walk.</p>
