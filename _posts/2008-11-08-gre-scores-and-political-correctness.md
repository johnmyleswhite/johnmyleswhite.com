This week a table of average GRE scores for different academic disciplines has been circulating around the economic blogosphere. You can see it at Greg Mankiw's blog [here](http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/11/larry-vindicated.html).

After a colleague pointed the chart out to me today, I decided that I would combine the GRE scores with [self-identification scores of political correctness from another chart that made its way around my circle of friends a few months ago](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/07/25/pc). Below you'll find the resulting scatterplot and regression line.

The correlation coefficient in the chart is -0.63, indicating a noticeable decline in GRE performance as one transitions to groups that are more PC. You can figure out the implications of that statement for yourself.
