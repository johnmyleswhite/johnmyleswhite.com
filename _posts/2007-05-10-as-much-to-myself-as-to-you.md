<p>It's okay to not wanna go. It's okay if you've got to. It's okay to be missing me. It's okay not to.</p>

<p>There are things that we can never give and things that we never can't.</p>

<p>As much to myself as to you. As much a list of questions as a list of what to do. If no one believes it, it's true. As much to myself as to you, to you.</p>

<p>The gifts and the name are a blade. We're not made the same, but we're all ashamed to be made. It's so unbelieveable that we can never believe. All these things that we wanna kill. All these things that we wanna save.</p>

<p>There are things that we can never give and things that we never can't.</p>

<p>As much to myself as to you. As much a list of questions as a list of what to do. If no one believes it, it's true. As much to myself as to you, to you.</p>
