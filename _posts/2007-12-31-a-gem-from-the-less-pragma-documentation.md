Reading through the Perl documentation on pragmas (pragmata for the Hellenophiles) this morning, I discovered the following gem:

<blockquote>
<p>**CAVEATS**</p>

<p>*   This probably does nothing.<br/>
*   This works only on 5.10+</p>

<p>At least it's backwards compatible in not doing much.</p>

<small>perldoc : less pragma</small>
</blockquote>
