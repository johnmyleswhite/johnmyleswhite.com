Rereading Steven Pinker's [recent essay](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/11/magazine/11Genome-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all) on [the Personal Genomic Project](http://www.personalgenomes.org/) -- and genetics more generally --, I was particularly struck by this line:

<blockquote>
<p>All of us already live with the knowledge that we have the fatal genetic condition called mortality, and most of us cope using some combination of denial, resignation and religion.</p>
</blockquote>
