I continue to have the same suspicion -- that the single greatest improvement possible for humanity would be an increase in its average IQ such that its new average would be near our current 140. It seems to me that this change would eliminate most of the wrongs that today cause the great majority of misery on Earth: war, hunger, crime -- all of this seems easily preventable. The problem is not one of social organization, but of the raw material of society. Men today are, far more than selfish, simply too stupid to live well.
