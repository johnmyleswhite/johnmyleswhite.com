I just received an e-mail from the Personal Genome Project. They are finally ready to expand to a larger number of volunteers. I hope I'll be among the next set of volunteers accepted into the program. Anyone interested in volunteering themselves should go to [the Personal Genome Project website](http://www.personalgenomes.org/participate.html) and register.
