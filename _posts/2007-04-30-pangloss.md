What is a man? An animal that breaks under the weight of temptation and wonder, then, having broken once, breaks again under the weight of a guilt he cannot bear, the burden of an atonement he cannot make. And so he finds a way to find good in his crimes, to deny their senselessness, their pointlessness -- all to escape from the weight of his own conscience. And thus man is the only animal who has invented divine Providence, fatalism born of man's great fragility. And he ultimately manages to stifle, strangle and finally slaughter his own conscience.
