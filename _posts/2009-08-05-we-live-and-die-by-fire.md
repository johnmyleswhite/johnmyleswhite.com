<blockquote>
<p>There is no safe investment: to love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one -- not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully around with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in a casket or a coffin of your selfishness. And in that casket -- safe, dark, motionless, airless -- it will change. It will not be broken. It will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. For love is to be vulnerable.</p>

<small>C. S. Lewis</small>

I am so glad to have finally acquired a copy of The Frozen Ocean's self-titled album. It starts with the passage quoted above, which comes from C. S. Lewis and perfectly sets the tone for the record. Merely hearing the album makes me want to direct the sort of movie about love for which the album would be the perfect soundtrack.
