There is a facial expression that exists only in Europe and not in America: it is one of an astonishment that includes no fear for oneself. To me, this expression summarizes the entirety of my feelings why I prefer Europe over America: in Europe, there is still enough faith in real standards of behavior that one can be shocked; in America, nothing surprises anyone anymore because there is no minimal level of sanity that one can expect.
