Every year, I come to agree more and more with this passage from "The Gay Science":

<blockquote>
<p><em>Truthfulness</em>.-- I favor any skepsis to which I may reply: "Let us try it!" But I no longer wish to hear anything of all those things and questions that do not permit any experiment. This is the limit of my "truthfulness": for there courage has lost its right.</p>
