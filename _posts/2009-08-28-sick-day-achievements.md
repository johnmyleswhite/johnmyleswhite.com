Spending my day at home while being sick has at least one perk: I can catch up with everything on the Internet that I've put off reading. After a day of RSS feed reading, I've compiled a list of things that I think are awesome and another list of things that I think are awful.

**Things I think are awesome:**

* Robots will take over the world one day: after all, here's [a Sudoku-solving Lego Mindstorms robot.](http://hackaday.com/2009/08/24/lego-mindstorms-sudoku-solver/)
* Even better, there's also [a Rubik's Cube-solving Lego Mindstorms robot.](http://www.tiltedtwister.com/index.html)
* My friend Jim Keller's latest project was featured on [the Drupal main page today.](http://drupal.org/node/552628)
* [Those cheating chimpanzee women](http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090828/full/news.2009.870.html) are not to be trusted.
* How often [does your Congressperson speak up?](http://www.congressspeaks.com/)
* Here's [the 56th Carnival of Mathematics](http://stochastix.wordpress.com/2009/08/27/carnival-of-mathematics-56/)
* Cognitive psychology has something to say about the use of [gendered words in language.](http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2009/08/la_raison_i_had_to_learn_gende.php)
* [A clever scheme](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/08/how_to_stay_sol.html) from Bryan Caplan for making money in an irrational economy.
* Because [repelling just gets boring after a while.](http://vimeo.com/6316588)

**Things I think are awful:**

* [The Rule of Law is flouted once again](http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/08/28/in-massachusetts-the-rule-of-law-dies/) by an American state.
* Swedish regulation [at its stupidest.](http://techdirt.com/articles/20090827/1929016027.shtml)

* Most cyclists are killed by [terrible drivers.](http://www.projectfreeride.org/team/cycling_health_and_safety/index.php?slide=2)
* Still think that our [government officials can be trusted?](http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202433411400&Former_NY_Judge_Convicted_of_Attempted_Extortion_and_Soliciting_Bribes)
* Eugene Volokh notes [a recent and dangerous precedent for homeschoolers](http://volokh.com/posts/1251405593.shtml) in a case that he wishes never had to be decided by the legal system.
