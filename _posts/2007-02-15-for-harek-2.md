<blockquote>
<p>Do not let the ingratitude of many men deter you from doing good to others. To do good without ulterior motive is a generous and almost divine thing in itself. Moreover, while doing good, you may come across someone so grateful that he makes up for all the ingratitude of others.</p>

<small>Francesco Guicciardini : Ricordi : Series C, 11</small>
</blockquote>

For Harek, who I know will appreciate it.
