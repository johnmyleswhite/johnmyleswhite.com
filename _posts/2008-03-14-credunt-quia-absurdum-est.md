It struck me this morning, while I was reviewing one of Augustine's book, that God, as presented in Christian theology, is rather like the set of all sets that made na√Øve set theory impossible to defend and that therefore led Russell to pursue his great, and ultimately futile, attempt to construct a consistent system of logic that would give rise to all of mathematical truth. God is given, by the theologian's definitions, a set of mutually irreconcilable traits, and theology consists largely of the attempt to create enough *ad hoc* rules and to redefine enough items of daily-life's vocabulary that one can sustain discussion of God's nature without patently contradicting oneself. God's omnipotence, His foreknowledge of all events, His absolute beneficence, His omnipresence: together these traits demand that the believer abandon reason itself and make of himself a great sophist to sustain his beliefs.
