Kaufmann notes the failures of the common proverb that "powers corrupts": the causal chain is too much shortened. "It is not that power corrupts, but that power attracts the corruptible", he says. This too can be extended: "power attracts the corruptible, because, knowing that power must bring with it a responsibility that no one sane could bear, we can be sure that those who seek it must be so unencumbered by feelings of duty that they have no worries about such an enormous duty being given to them. Power is only desirable to those who have no sense of duty -- and hence those who cannot be trusted with power."

But since others put off accepting power, power goes time and again into their hands. In history, there are few, if any, Cincinnatis and even fewer Numas.
