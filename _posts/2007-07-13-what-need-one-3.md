<blockquote>
<p>KING LEAR: I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:<br />
I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:<br />
We'll no more meet, no more see one another:<br />
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;<br />
Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,<br />
Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,<br />
A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,<br />
In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;<br />
Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:<br />
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,<br />
Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:<br />
Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:<br />
I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,<br />
I and my hundred knights.</p>

<p>REGAN: Not altogether so:<br />
I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided<br />
For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;<br />
For those that mingle reason with your passion<br />
Must be content to think you old, and so --<br />
But she knows what she does.</p>

<p>KING LEAR: Is this well spoken?</p>

<p>REGAN: I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?<br />
Is it not well? What should you need of more?<br />
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger<br />
Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,<br />
Should many people, under two commands,<br />
Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.</p>

<p>GONERIL: Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance<br />
From those that she calls servants or from mine?</p>

<p>REGAN: Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,<br />
We could control them. If you will come to me,--<br />
For now I spy a danger,-- I entreat you<br />
To bring but five and twenty: to no more<br />
Will I give place or notice.</p>

<p>KING LEAR: I gave you all--</p>

<p>REGAN: And in good time you gave it.</p>

<p>KING LEAR: Made you my guardians, my depositaries;<br />
But kept a reservation to be follow'd<br />
With such a number. What, must I come to you<br />
With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?</p>

<p>REGAN: And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.</p>

<p>KING LEAR: Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,<br />
When others are more wicked: not being the worst<br />
Stands in some rank of praise.</p>

<p>(To GONERIL)<br />
I'll go with thee:<br />
Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,<br />
And thou art twice her love.</p>

<p>GONERIL: Hear me, my lord;<br />
What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,<br />
To follow in a house where twice so many<br />
Have a command to tend you?</p>

<p>REGAN: What need one?</p>

<p>KING LEAR: O, reason not the need: our basest beggars<br />
Are in the poorest thing superfluous:<br />
Allow not nature more than nature needs,<br />
Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;<br />
If only to go warm were gorgeous,<br />
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,<br />
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--<br />
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!<br />
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,<br />
As full of grief as age; wretched in both!<br />
If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts<br />
Against their father, fool me not so much<br />
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,<br />
And let not women's weapons, water-drops,<br />
Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,<br />
I will have such revenges on you both,<br />
That all the world shall--I will do such things,--<br />
What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be<br />
The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep<br />
No, I'll not weep:<br />
I have full cause of weeping; but this heart<br />
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,<br />
Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!</p>
<small>William Shakespeare : King Lear : II, iv</small>

Ultimately the structure of all human conflict is this: two parties have mutually opposed desires; both being irrational and incapable of justification in any cosmic sense, the arguments in defense of their desires are rejected by the flawless logic of the other party; as such, the two parties destroy one another.

In this life, the only variable in this equation is how long two people can go before their desires become so deeply opposed that they can only harm one another. Given a high enough value, one is left to think the value is infinite and that love is eternal. In truth, all that matters is that it be high enough to last until our own death.
