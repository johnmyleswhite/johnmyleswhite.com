It's sad how easy it can be to catalog American democracy's faults. As a case study, consider that [the Oklahoma state government](http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2009-10bills/HB/HR1015_hflr.rtf) was just recently working to prevent Richard Dawkins from speaking at the University of Oklahoma because his

<blockquote>
<p>public statements on the theory of evolution demonstrate an intolerance for cultural diversity and diversity of thinking and are views that are not shared and are not representative of the thinking of a majority of the citizens of Oklahoma.</p>

It is disheartening how quickly the ideal of diversity, which was traditionally a liberal dream, has become a tool that can be exploited by religious conservatives. This is the danger of introducing inane ideals without definite meanings: they are readily transformed into political shibboleths entirely lacking any intellectual content. The notion of diversity has no place in science; no more than it has any place in mathematics, where all propositions are either true or false.

Perhaps more interesting is that the Catholic Church, the greatest of antidemocratic structures, is holding a conference to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species," to which they have not invited any Creationist groups. Thankfully, diversity has never appealed to the Church, whose goal has always been unification under the one true belief. (That I do not think the belief is true in no way prevents my admiration for the Church's earnest singlemindedness.)
