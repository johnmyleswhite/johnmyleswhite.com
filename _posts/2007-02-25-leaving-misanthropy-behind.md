<blockquote>
<p>Since I no longer expect anything from mankind except madness, meanness, and mendacity; egotism, cowardice, and self-delusion, I have stopped being a misanthrope.</p>

<small>Irving Layton : The Wholy Bloody Bird</small>
</blockquote>

Originally written as poem, reset by myself as the prose it plainly is.
