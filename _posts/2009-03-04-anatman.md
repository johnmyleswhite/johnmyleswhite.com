The New York Times has [a remarkable story](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/nyregion/thecity/01miss.html?pagewanted=1) up about a New York school teacher who went missing for almost a month after suffering from a case of dissociative fugue. I particularly enjoy how the article portrays the fragility of a self and the potential for massive disconnection from our memories.

Also fascinating is the woman's assertion that "she can't let New York win." I am always surprised that non-native New Yorkers choose to live in a city that they view as an adversary. New York has always been home to me; sometimes it is too garish or agitating for me to stand, but it has never been an opponent to compete with in an effort to prove my ability to endure. If anything, the hardest thing for me is imagining living perpetually far away from New York.
