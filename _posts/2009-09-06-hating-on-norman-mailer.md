[This assault on Norman Mailer](http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/the-naked-novelist-and-the-dead-reputation-15228) impresses me more the more times I read it. I'm not familiar enough with Mailer to judge its accuracy, but the tone is perfect for my taste:

<blockquote>
<p>His vulgarity was a more significant factor in his allure than whatever he possessed of high aspiration. The way his most serious ambition was joined to his crassest need made him singularly appealing to a literary public that fed on nonsensical political ideas and fantasies of artistic superstardom, with its fabulous perquisites of cultural ubiquity, wealth, and hot sex.</p>
