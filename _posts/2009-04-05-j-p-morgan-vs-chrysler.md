I'm glad to see that [J. P. Morgan is fighting for the liquidation](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/04/jp_morgan_v_oba.html) of Chrysler. As far as I can see, Chrysler has been among the walking dead for decades. It was, after all, [bailed out once before](http://www.heritage.org/research/regulation/bg276.cfm), a few years before I was even born. Indeed, Chrysler's terrible historical performance is so notable that it's even mentioned in Jolliffe's [book on Principal Component Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/Principal-Component-Analysis-I-T-Jolliffe/dp/0387954422).
