[The Wall Street Journal's list of famous atheists](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-freethink0703-29.html) includes Richard Dawkins besides Voltaire, Nietzsche and Socrates.

Am I the only one who thinks Dawkins is not nearly sceptical enough to be my representative? Dawkins, impressive though he is, is not the equal of the men he is starting to be associated with. For Dawkins's hatred of religion shows that he fears it, but Nietzsche's fascination with religion shows that he is completely immune to its dangers. Free enough that the close of those famous words, "God is dead," is not what is expected:

<blockquote>
<p>God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves?</p>

<small>Friedrich Nietzsche : The Gay Science : 125</small>
