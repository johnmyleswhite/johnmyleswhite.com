In the past twenty four hours, I have seen [Tom Morello](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Morello) in [Iron Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(film)) and [Air Guitar Nation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Guitar_Nation). I can only say that his radical ideals suddenly seem even more disingenuous than before.
