[Andrew Gelman points out](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2009/12/all_meehl_all_t.html) that there is now [a website devoted entirely to Paul Meehl](http://www.tc.umn.edu/~pemeehl/pubCategories.htm).

In my mind, Paul Meehl was one of the greatest psychologists of the 20th century. Few other people in our field were more level-headed or insightful. Every paper written by Meehl is a delight to read, so this is a veritable treasure trove of material.
