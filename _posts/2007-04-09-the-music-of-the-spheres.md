[La belleza pasa desapercebida](http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/belleza/pasa/desapercibida/elpepucul/20070409elpepucul_1/Tes)

For those who do not read Spanish, the story says in short that one of the world's greatest violinists played on a ramp of the Washington Metro the other day as a sort of a sociological experiment and virtually no one noticed him and even fewer people appreciated what he was doing.

God, how much this story says about the state of life in America today! What a tragedy to think that we live under too much stress or pressure or fear or that we are too angry or frustrated or hurried in our daily lives to perceive the beautiful things around us, that we cannot stop for even a minute to appreciate how breathtaking the world can be.

Frank Herbert revealed something more profound than he realized when he said that "mercy is the ability to stop, even if just for a moment." For it is not just mercy that is founded upon the ability to pause for a moment, but all goodness.
