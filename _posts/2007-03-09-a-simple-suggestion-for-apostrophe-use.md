The plural of standard -s plural words never has an s sound added to indicate possession, so simply write an apostrophe at the end to show possession.

<blockquote>
	<p>The boys' bikes all broke that day.</p>
</blockquote>

The possessive of singular nouns ending in an s sound in contrast does add another s sound, so add an apostrophe and then an s in writing.

<blockquote>
	<p>Jesus's words were often polemical.</p>
</blockquote>

In the end, it's a simple test of pronunciation: add an 's where you make an extra s sound and add only an apostrophe where you do not.
