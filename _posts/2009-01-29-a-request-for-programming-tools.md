Now that I do a great deal of my programming in Ruby, there are two tools I constantly miss from my Perl days: [Perl::Tidy](http://perltidy.sourceforge.net/) and [Perl::Critic](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Critic/). For those who've never done any Perl hacking, the first is a code formatting tool and the second analyzes Perl code for the presence of common stylistic weaknesses. They are both exceptionally high quality programs.

Does anyone know of code formatting and analysis tools for Ruby? My highest priority is a code formatting tool, but I would be delighted to have an analysis program as well. I'm also very interested in any similar tools for Python, R, Matlab or Clojure.
