Every time I hear these words I grimace and then chuckle. No better example exists of a songwriter using words that he clearly does not entirely understand in hopes of sounding more intellectual than he is -- or at least none comes to mind.

Of course, such mistakes are inevitable in the arts because of what is best in the artist: one aspires to what one thinks of as an ideal, but as one only vaguely grasps the ideal, one produces inferior copies based on one's limited understanding. The writer hears abstract nouns and words that are not quotidian, and he finds them beautiful; in his attempts to produce similar beauty, he attempts to use such words and manages only to misuse them.

One has to have sympathy for such things, even if they are insufficient for our needs: they are the best attempts of the aspirant to something more.
