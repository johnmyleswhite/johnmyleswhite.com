Whenever possible, a writer should avoid allowing the same word to be repeated twice in a row within a single sentence, unless the writer intends to produce the rhetorical effect of *geminatio*. Sentences that contain phrases like, (a) "I think that that is not true," or, (b) "these strings differ at at least two different locations," are confusing upon the first reading. Avoid this construction whenever a clearer sentence can be constructed by using different words or rearranging the sentence syntactically.
