<blockquote>
<p>My love overflows. My skull overflows. But my heart never breaks. We pray for petty things in our petty lives as if God has the time. There is a reason we feel so small when we've lost our reason to thrive.</p>

<p>Everyone is fucked. Everyone is damned. But no one will open their eyes. Have you ever heard a joke like this before? I raise a toast to a genius god. I live in a big house with all of my friends. I sing these stupid songs. I roam all these highways. I hope it never ends. And when I think about it all it's almost too much to bear.</p>

<p>It's hell and it opens your eyes.</p>

<p>When I think about it all it's almost too much to bear.</p>

<p>It's heaven and it opens your eyes.</p>

Though I don't generally like the jarring effect of adding a new voice into a hardcore song in the middle, the lyrics for the section that Brooks Strause sings on the closing track of the new Modern Life Is War album are too good for me to complain about his appearance. Besides that, I already loved his voice and everything about his performances after I saw him play live a few months ago in Brooklyn.

Little things, little things. Petty things, petty things.
