Thanks to Sad Kermit ([www.sadkermit.com](http://www.sadkermit.com)), I've been listening to this record a lot lately. And every time this song comes on, I focus on this line and think about how many women I've known that were described by those words. It is truly horrible to think there is an inescapable core of sadism in masculinity and of masochism in femininity.
