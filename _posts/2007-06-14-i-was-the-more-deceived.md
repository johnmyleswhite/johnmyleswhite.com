<blockquote>
<p>I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be not too hasty to trust, or to admire, the teachers of morality; they discourse like angels, but they live like men.</p>

<small>Samuel Johnson</small>

I think both of these disclaimers should be extended to everyone before they meet me.
