It is very easy to confuse innocence in pleasure -- simple guiltlessness about one's own happiness in a world filled with suffering -- with the refusal to accept pain even when such pain -- the pain of remorse for instance -- should be felt. God help you when you cause pain to those who flee from all suffering: their ceaseless need for happiness tolerates no bounds and your pain will prove utterly inconsequential to them.
