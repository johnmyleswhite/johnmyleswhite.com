Part of the reason I find it difficult to take our two party system seriously is that Americans from both parties tend to hold very similar beliefs -- often on precisely those issues over which I wish there were more disagreement. As a case in point, consider [today's Pew report on attitudes towards "buying American"](http://pewresearch.org/databank/dailynumber/?NumberID=722):

I find it remarkable that so many Americans feel that our economy cannot thrive unless we avoid consuming import goods. And I find it doubly worrisome that this belief is comparably strong among both Democrats and Republicans.

In fairness to my fellow Americans, though, I should note that the question from this survey seems to frame the issue with the intention of promoting these responses. Specifically, the "good idea" response is actually a "good idea -- keeps jobs in the U.S." response, while the "bad idea" response is actually a "bad idea -- risks trade retaliation" response. I would suspect that a question that does not imply such a militaristic view of trade would be answered differently.
