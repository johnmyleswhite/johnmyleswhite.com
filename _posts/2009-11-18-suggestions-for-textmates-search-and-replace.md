Like so many other programmers, I adore [TextMate](http://macromates.com/). For that reasons, here are two simple features that I'd enjoy seeing in the next version:

* A case-preserving search and replace tool. If I search for a string like `my_class` and want to replace it with `my_new_class`, I'd like `my_class` to transform into `my_new_class` at the same time that `MyClass` transforms into `MyNewClass`.
* A version of search and replace that also edits filenames. If I replace `MyClass` with `MyNewClass` everywhere, I'd like to have the file named `MyClass.java` renamed to `MyNewClass.java` at the same time. </ol> 
    Both of these would save me from a ton of stupid code drift problems while performing a global search and replace. Do other people think these are interesting enough to merit suggesting them directly to Allan Oddgaard?
