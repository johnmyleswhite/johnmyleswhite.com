Liberal, n. A man who laments the absence of compassion and sense of duty to the lower classes on the part of the upper classes, but fails to show even basic decency towards his friends, family and the others he comes across in his personal life; a man who feels deep compassion for those he does not know, but little sympathy for those he does; a man who deifies the abstract idea of morality, but shows little interest in its practical application; a Tartuffe.
