I loved my Oscar Wilde widget and its endless supply of clever snipes at human pretense, but I discovered today that it was using, by itself, a full 250MB of memory to run. Has anyone else ever used the widget and seen this kind of memory use? I almost suspect virus-like behavior with that amount of memory being committed to one widget. Or is it simply a very severe memory leak coupled with excess caching? Does anyone know about this? Because I could find not information about this on Google, I have no plans to run the widget ever again, but I would like to.

And to think that people are so indignant about the WordPress modifications.
