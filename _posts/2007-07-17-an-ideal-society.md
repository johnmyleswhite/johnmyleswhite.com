The traditional vision of utopia is an image of a society that cannot be built using the pieces we have access to: humans, with their inescapable need to construct social hierarchies and their inexorable requirement for sexual exclusivity, cannot create nor live in without destroying a society in which all men love and respect one another.

Given that we accept that such a society is impossible, the task of improving society amounts to something very different: the ideal society is that in which those who can benefit one another are brought together and those who can only harm one another are kept separate.

Incidentally, this is, to my mind, the major purpose of the group-oriented family structure that Huxley's Island proposes.
