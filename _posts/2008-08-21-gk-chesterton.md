After spending more than two years on the list of authors I want to explore, I've finally begun reading G. K. Chesterton's "The Man Who Was Thursday." There is a brilliant passage at the start that I plan to quote in the future, but for now I thought I should quote this wonderful aphorism of Chesterton's, which is cited in Leonard E. Read's [I, Pencil](http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl1.html):

<blockquote>
<p>We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders.</p>

<small>G. K. Chesterton</small>
</blockquote>
