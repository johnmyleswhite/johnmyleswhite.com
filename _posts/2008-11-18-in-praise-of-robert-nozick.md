Several of my favorite economics bloggers have praised Robert Nozick during the past few days, whose 70th birthday would have been this past Sunday. I have considerable respect for Nozick, but must admit that this anecdote from [David Henderson's post](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2008/11/nozick_and_smar.html) on [Econlog](http://econlog.econlib.org) strikes me as more impressive than any specific part of Nozick's considerable philosophical output:

<blockquote>
<p>The second thing I remember that always stands out was from an interview Nozick did in the 1970s or 1980s, I believe with Reason, in which he talked about a left-wing student who threatened to forcibly prevent Nozick from teaching a class on capitalism at Harvard. Nozick took the man aside and, in his recounting, threatened to "beat the s**t out of him." The class went on as scheduled.</p>
