The one single problem with the claim that all of philosophy is a series of footnotes on the works of Plato is that it misrepresents Existentialism, which is more accurately described as being no more than a series of footnotes on King Lear.

If one understands this, one has understood both Existentialism's real core and the real profundity of King Lear; moreover, one understands what constitutes good writing, because Shakespeare says in King Lear what Camus and Sartre said over the course of their entire production -- and said less beautifully.

<p>As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport.</p>
