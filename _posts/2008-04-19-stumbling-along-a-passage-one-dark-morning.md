<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Ramsay, stumbling along a passage one dark morning, stretched his arms out, but Mrs. Ramsay having died rather suddenly the night before, his arms, though stretched out, remained empty.</p>

Odd though it may seem, this passage for me has always embodied one of the core parts of love: the ever-presence of another, whose absence is therefore so acutely felt.
