Like Plato, I am of the opinion that no one without careful training in logic should be allowed to have any say in the government of society: the average person simply has no conception of the implications of what he says. Most beliefs win followers simply because the believers are too stupid to realize that the inevitable conclusions of their beliefs are revolting to them.
