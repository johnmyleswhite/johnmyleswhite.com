Love seems often to me more evil and less clean than hatred, for hatred intends to create the suffering it creates and thus sets some limit to it, but love, causing suffering only as an undesired byproduct of its work, will stop at nothing to follow its course. O, a love burning brighter than a thousand suns -- how many charred bodies it leaves behind it, like a soldier without remorse or doubts about the righteousness of his cause!
