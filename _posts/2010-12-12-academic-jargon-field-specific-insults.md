Every academic field seems to develop a set of generic insults based on their intellectual toolkit. Here are two examples I hear often:

* **Probabilists and Statisticians**: "I think that's an interesting case, but it's in a set with measure zero."
* **Economists**: "X group's behavior is clearly rent-seeking."

Do any readers have good examples from other fields?
