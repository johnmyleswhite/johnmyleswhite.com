Bryan Caplan recently put up [a great post](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/03/wise_observatio.html) describing the take away lessons he thinks behavioral genetics offers to parents and singles:

<blockquote>
<p>The practical lesson of behavioral genetics for parents, in my view, is to stop trying so hard to change your kids. The practical lesson of Rowe's evidence for singles, in contrast, seems to be that you should hold out for a very close match. Once you accept that the person you marry is unlikely to "grow into" in the changes that you urge upon him or her, the sensible response is to rely more heavily on the power of selection.</p>
