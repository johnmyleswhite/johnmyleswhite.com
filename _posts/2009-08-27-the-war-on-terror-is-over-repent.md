Here's an excerpt from a WSJ piece on "The War on Terror" that I found bewildering:

<blockquote>
<p>Individually, some of this may be arguable. In toto, it's a death sentence for an effective war on terror. It makes what's left of the war—telephone wiretaps or monitoring money transfers—vulnerable to a steady stream of congressional and legal objection. That lets the Obama administration evade political responsibility by letting others wind down the war on terror.</p>

<p>The message of Scotland's release and the Holder decision is that the will born in the wake of 9/11 is waning. The war on terror is being downgraded to not much more than tough talk.</p>

<small>Daniel Henninger : The Wall Street Journal : <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203706604574374500451334282.html#articleTabs%3Darticle">The War on Terror Is Over</a></small>
</blockquote>

And here are some edits I'd suggest for this section of the piece:

<blockquote>
<p>Individually, some of this may be arguable. In toto, it's a death sentence for an <em>unconstitutional</em> war on terror. It makes what's left of the war -— <em>illegal wiretapping</em> or <em>illegitimately</em> monitoring money transfers -— vulnerable to a <em>well-deserved</em>, steady stream of congressional and legal objection. That lets the Obama administration evade political responsibility by letting others wind down the war on terror.</p>

<p>The message of Scotland's release and the Holder decision is that the <em>paranoia</em> born in the wake of 9/11 is waning. The war on terror is being <em>finally recognized for the absurdity it has always been.</em> </p>
