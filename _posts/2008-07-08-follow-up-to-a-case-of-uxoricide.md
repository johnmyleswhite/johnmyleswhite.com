As evidence against the claims of every person who insists that the opinions of all people in our society need to be respected, I submit the following evidence from the recent prosecution of Hans Reiser for uxoricide:

* [Exhibit A](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/04/reiser-guilty-o.html) -- The comments posted on the Wired article that reported Reiser's conviction.
* [Exhibit B](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/07/07/BAN011LDR8.DTL) -- A recent article from the SF Gate reporting that Reiser has given police his dead wife's body in exchange for a reduced sentence.

Let the criterion of reasonable doubt stand, and let us conclude not that our courts are unjust, but rather that many of Reiser's defenders are too irrational to understand when justice has been done. Perhaps Aristotle would have commented on the whole ordeal, "hoi polloi alogoi."

In closing, I cite the comment left at 3:50:20 P.M. on April 28th, 2008 on the Wired article featured as Exhibit A. It is, I think, a remarkable sample of the perversions of the human mind.

<blockquote>
<p>the last sentences sum up the American justice system.</p>
 
<p>"<em>You are rude,</em> he said. <em>You are arrogant. There are not enough words in the English language to describe the way you are.</em></p>
 
<p>But the jurors found a word on Monday: guilty."</p>
 
<p>The man was convicted for murder, not because he was guilty, but because he was "rude and arrogant".</p>
 
<p>The man knows for sure he is more intelligent than most of those apes around him. And he has some disdain for them. And it shows -- not openly, but enough for them to understand. And they choose to stick it to him.</p>
 
<p>This is not justice. This is mob rule. It is sick and perverted. Anmerica, the land of the lynch mob.</p>
</blockquote>

If you have so much disdain for your fellow men, it is reasonable to wonder if you might consider murdering one of them without regret. This by itself makes your case hard to sustain, and so much more so when other evidence also suggests that you murdered your own children's mother.
