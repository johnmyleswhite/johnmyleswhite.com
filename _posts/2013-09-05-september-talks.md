To celebrate my last full month on the East Coast, I'm doing a bunch of talks. If you're interested in hearing more about Julia or statistics in general, you might want to come out to one of the events I'll be at:

* **Julia Tutorial at DataGotham**: On 9/12, Stefan and I will be giving a 3-hour long, hands on [Julia tutorial as part of the Thursday DataGotham activities this year](http://www.datagotham.com/tutorials/). If you're in NYC and care about data analysis, you should try to make it out to part of the event, even if you skip the tutorials.
* **Online Learning Talk in NYC**: On 9/17, I'll be giving a talk on online learning at the [Open Statistical Programming meetup](http://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/137465262/). I'll talk about using SGD to fit models online. This material is quite basic, but seems to be unfamiliar to a lot of people.
* **Julia Talk in DC**: On 9/26, I'll be giving a quick introduction to Julia in DC at the [Statistical Programming DC meetup](http://www.meetup.com/stats-prog-dc/events/138392652/). The goal will be to introduce people to the basics of Julia.
