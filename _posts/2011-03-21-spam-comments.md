I may have deleted a genuine comment by accident today while cleaning out the spam queue. My apologies if it was yours. I generally delete all the comments in my spam queue without checking their contents carefully because of their quantity. Only after clicking the delete button a few moments ago did I notice that one of the comments contained the phrase "random variable" and might actually have been a genuine comment. Sadly, it's irretrievably gone.
