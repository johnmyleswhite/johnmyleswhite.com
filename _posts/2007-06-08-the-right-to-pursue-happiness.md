<blockquote>
<p>The Constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness. You have to catch it yourself.</p>

<small>Benjamin Franklin</small>
</blockquote>

What an absurd notion. The ability to pursue happiness is not something that can be taken away and hence not something that can be codified into a right that can be granted by governments. Certain preconditions for happiness can be denied by a nation: food, safety from violence, a fulfilling emotional connection to one's compatriots -- but no one who has read either Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus or Milton's Paradise Lost can be so ignorant as to think that the capacity to find happiness in this world can be taken away from any man.
