<p>The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes.</p>

I came upon this yesterday and thought it very beautiful, beyond also being very poignant, as it is equivalent to Gomez Davila's point about the bourgeoisie. Ultimately, this is the great dichotomy of human types, the divide between those who seek to conquer the world and those who seek to conquer themselves -- the Alexanders and the Tathagatas --, those who seek to get more from life and those who seek to put more into it -- the Dorian Grays and the William Blakes --, those who seek to have more and those who seek to be more.
