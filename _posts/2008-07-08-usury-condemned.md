On [Amateur Economists](http://www.amateureconomists.com
), I just read the following words:

<blockquote>
<p> McCain chastises "speculators" and says he wishes interest rates could be 0%.</p>

<small><a href="http://www.amateureconomists.com/view_articles_detail.php?aid=37">Amateur Economists : Where the "Other" Candidates Stand on Economic Issues</a></small>
</blockquote>

Is this claim true? Has McCain really said something like this? I was aware that McCain likes to emphasize traditional Christian values, but this is a throwback to the most ancient sort of Christian sentiment -- as ancient as, for example, the [First Council of Carthage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_at_Carthage).
