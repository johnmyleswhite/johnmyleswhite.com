<blockquote>
"What we're learning here is really the bedrock difference between the United States and the countries that are in a broad sense its legal cousins," Mr. Steyn added. "<em>Western governments are becoming increasingly comfortable with the regulation of opinion</em>. The First Amendment really does distinguish the U.S., not just from Canada but from the rest of the Western world."

I have added the emphasis to these incredibly important words, quoted in a New York Times [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/12/us/12hate.html?pagewanted=3&_r=1&hp&adxnnlx=1213277183-XCeIW1sEiCcYBk%20aH48QNg) on an important upcoming free speech trial in Canada.

There are times when one must be grateful for those strengths America possesses that the rest of the world so readily condemns.
