<blockquote>
<p>There is something to be learned from a rainstorm. When meeting with a sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road. But doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still get wet. When you are resolved from the beginning, you will not be perplexed, though you still get the same soaking. This understanding extends to everything.</p>

Given the endless rains we've had lately, I decided to watch Ghost Dog tonight, which I hadn't seen in a few years. It was as good as I remember it being -- and, as always, the citations from the Hagakure are permanently apropos.
