<small>Honoré de Balzac : Père Goriot : Chapter 1</small>

I've just started reading Balzac for the first time. And after reading this, I can easily understand the comparisons made between Houellebecq and Balzac, though the differences are also noteworthy. Houellebecq's philosophical observations as voiced by the external narrator demonstrate articulate a single theory of human behavior rather like La Rochefoucald's: one in which a small of basic principles interact to create a larger whole of behaviors that at least seem to arise from contradictory aims. In contrast, Balzac, like Chamfort, seems rather to have no singular vision, but only many, many isolated and disconnected visions of human behavior -- though the observations are extremely acute and perhaps more comprehensible than La Rochefoucauld's.
