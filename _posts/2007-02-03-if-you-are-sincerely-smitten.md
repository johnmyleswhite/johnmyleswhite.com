<blockquote>
<p>Your only chance of survival, if you are sincerely smitten, lies in hiding this fact from the woman you love, of feigning a casual detachment under all circumstances. What sadness there is in this simple observation! What an accusation against man! However, it had never occured to me to contest this law, nor to imagine disobeying it: love makes you weak, and the weaker of the two is oppressed, tortured, and finally killed by the other, who in his or her turn oppresses, tortures, and kill without having evil intentions, without even getting pleasure from it, with complete indifference; that's what men, normally, call love.</p>

It is decided: given only Houellebecq and Shakespeare's complete works, I would never have any need for the rest of world literature.
