There are two primary approaches to changes in our lives. In the first, change is a source of fear: they expect little from their new world and fear the loss of their old world. They are most loyal to their loved ones before they embark on change; soon thereafter they have little loyalty left. In the second group, change is a source of excitement: they expect much from novelty and are invariably disappointed that there is less change than they had hoped for. They are least loyal to their loved ones before a change, wondering whether there may not be reasons for betrayal provided by their new environment, but soon after having discovered their new world, find that it is no different from their old world and prefer what they had before simply because its familiarity makes it superior to an unknown, but equal, opportunity.
