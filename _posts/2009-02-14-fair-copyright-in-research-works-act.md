Given that we know that the Democrats are the party of the people, it must come as a surprise that [Democratic Representative John Conyers](http://conyers.house.gov/) [has re-introduced the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/02/conyers-bill-is-back.html), which will remove the legal requirement that all research performed by federal agencies be published in journals providing open access to the general public. Quite simply, this bill would restore a system in which the public is taxed to pay for research that it is then not allowed access to.

Or does it not seem all that surprising that a Democrat would do this? The co-sponsors include others Democrats and Republicans, so it seems quite clear that betraying the American people is a bipartisan movement in Congress.
