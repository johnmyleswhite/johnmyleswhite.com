<blockquote>
<p>Humans, or at least the most advanced among them, already knew that unconditional love is the condition for the possibility of happiness.</p>

<small>Michel Houellebecq : The Possibility Of An Island : Daniel 24, 6</small>
</blockquote>

As with so many of Houellebecq's generalizations, this is not exactly true, but it is nevertheless a beautiful and wonderful observation, because it is quite near the truth -- and the truth is one to which few other authors have ever come near.

It is not entirely true, because unconditional love simply does not exist: if we believe we have found it, it is only that we are unaware of the conditions for its existence. If our love were unconditional, we would love, as do the victims of Cupid's arrows, the very first person who comes before our eyes. We are rather more particular than that and the basis of this particularity is found in the conditions under which we love.

Thus, what is relevant is not the absence of conditions, but the conditions themselves -- for these differ greatly from one human to the next and in them we see the entire natures of those we observe. A man's character is grasped entirely in his capacity for love and in its expression in practice.

Those capable of any enduring love are interested in very different things than those whose experiences with love constantly end poorly: their interests are noticeably less superficial, they are more forgiving of faults or even find that what others call faults are to them cause only for further love, they are easily intoxicated by anyone with whom they are capable of any deep emotional intimacy. They are not especially particular physically: like Donne in "The Indifferent", they find the world absolutely filled with attractive people. Because of this universal attraction, they learn to distinguish far more subtler among those who attract them with age. Their very natures seem centered upon the ability, rather than the need, to love. In the characters of those capable of such simple and plain love is found the sole basis for lasting happiness.
