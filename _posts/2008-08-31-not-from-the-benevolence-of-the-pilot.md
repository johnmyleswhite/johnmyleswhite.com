Every time I have doubts about how safe flying is, I think to myself:

<blockquote>
<p>It is not from the benevolence of the pilot that I expect not to die after crashing into a mountain, but from the pilot's regard to his own interest.</p>
</blockquote>

It amazes me how this line of reasoning seems to never enter into the minds of those whose fear of flying is so great that they simply refuse to board planes. It is as if they genuinely believe that the pilot, who flies many times each week, is not concerned with keeping himself alive.

I suspect the only relevant criterion for selecting potential pilots is an estimate of their disposition to suicidal behavior.
