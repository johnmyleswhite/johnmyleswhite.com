I can sincerely say that I hate the experience of writing a philosophical book: nothing is ever clear enough, nor is it ever eloquent enough, nor is the work considered as a whole ever sufficiently well-structured. These are insoluble problems in the abstract for any writer of philosophy; they are problems only to be solved by discovering one's own prose style and accepting a conditional balance between eloquence and clarity, between the breadth of ideas considered and the depth with which they are treated. I want to write a book that thrills the reader like Nietzsche's prose, but which is not plagued by the misunderstandings to which Nietzsche has been exposed; a book which seems to defend its statements rather than make pronouncement after pronouncement without evidence. This careful argumentation necessarily slows the pace of what is written, though, and suddenly less and less can be said in the same amount of space. The world does not seem to be reborn with every paragraph , but I may at least convince more readers to accept what I am saying -- and I think what I am saying is so very important and needs to be not only said, but put into practice.

When I have finished with this book, I am going to try my hand at fiction again: first, several short stories, then a novel. I suspect that after I have produced a good storyline the prose will come much more easily than it does now.
