English is a curious language: you can recognize a bookish young man by how many obscure words he uses correctly in regards to their meaning while yet mispronouncing them. And you can recognize how smart he is by how many of those words he pronounces as they ought to be pronounced if logic determined their spelling rather than accidents of history.
