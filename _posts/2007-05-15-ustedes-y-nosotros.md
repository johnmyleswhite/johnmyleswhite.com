Because I feel guilty that someone came here the other day looking for a translation of "Ustedes y nosotros" by Benedetti only to not find one, here is a very, very simple translation meant only to get across the sense of the poem. Even then I am not totally sure of the sense of the words "cortedad" and "piola" in the original and am not content with the translations of some words I understand, but find hard to express in English.

<blockquote>
<p>You, when you love,<br />
Demand comfort,<br />
A cedar bed<br />
And a special mattress.<br />
We, when we love,<br />
Find it easy to make the bed.<br />
How great to have sheets,<br />
How little it matters not to.<br />
You, when you love,<br />
Calculate interest,<br />
And when you fall out of it,<br />
You calculate again,<br />
We, when we love,<br />
Feel as if reborn,<br />
And if we fall out of it,<br />
We do not take it well.<br />
You, when you love,<br />
It's on another scale,<br />
There are photos, gossip, press<br />
And love is a boom.<br />
We, when we love,<br />
Have a common love,<br />
As simple and as tasty<br />
As being healthy.<br />
You, when you love,<br />
Consult your watch,<br />
Because the time that you lose<br />
Is worth half a million.<br />
We, when we love,<br />
Enjoy it without any rush and with fervor<br />
And it turns out that<br />
The task doesn't cost us much.<br />
You, when you love,<br />
Go to the psychoanalyst;<br />
He's the one who determines<br />
If you're doing right or not.<br />
We, when we love,<br />
Don't have so much constraint,<br />
Our kind subconscious<br />
Gets set to enjoy itself.<br />
You, when you love,<br />
Demand comfort,<br />
A cedar bed<br />
And a special mattress.<br />
We, when we love,<br />
Find it easy to make the bed.<br />
How great to have sheets,<br />
How little it matters not to.</p>
