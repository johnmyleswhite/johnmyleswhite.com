<p>While searching for the famous line from Dune saying that Arrakis teaches "the attitude of the knife", I came across this quote I had forgotten and which I once used as my motto for a year or two. Ironic as it seems only increasingly apropos every year.</p>

Seek freedom and become captive of your desires. Seek discipline and find your liberty.
