Whenever I think about any man who kills the man who has seduced his wife, I feel a certain warm admiration for him. Rationally, within the ethical theories I subscribe to, this action only makes the situation worse, by creating only more suffering; instinctively, though, -- and it is not such an irrational instinct -- I respect and even somewhat envy his choice. His action makes it so that all the rest of us sleep more comfortably in our homes beside our wives, he has reaffirmed the value of fidelity by reminding the world that there are still some who are willing to give their all by taking the life of whoever transgress against the law binding man and woman. In this, he is the truest sort of martyr, this murderer of adulterers.
