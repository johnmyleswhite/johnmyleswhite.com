[Peter Norvig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig) has [a great post on his website](http://norvig.com/chart538.html) about models used to claim that the primary system induces greater partisanship in our elected officials.

I'd encourage everyone to read it, if for no other reason than to see for yourself that Norvig really does call someone his "homey" while writing about simulated election results.

In general, I think Norvig's website is one of the treasure troves of knowledge on the Internet. Where else can you learn about the evils of Powerpoint and then learn about the virtues of Bayesian spelling correctors?
