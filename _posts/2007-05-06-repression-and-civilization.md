For all the good it has done, Freudian psychoanalysis has also done us one great disservice: it has slandered repression. This is madness, for repression is the essence of civilization; civilization consists solely in the repression of those instincts that make social life impossible, those old Darwinian cruelties that are so unabashedly apparent in the other mammals. If you consider it, you will see that the most civilized nations -- the modern Germans or Japanese for example -- are also the most repressed. A certain amount of neuroticism is the inevitable price of increasing levels of civilization. It must be borne in mind that civilization is not some binary division beween civilized and uncivilized. No, civilization is a gradual adaptation of the species to the conditions of living in large cities to be measured in millions of incremental steps.
