It's amazing how naturally selfishness comes to some people and how difficult a lesson learning it is for others. Some of us never really learn the lesson properly; some of us never cease to feel sickened and tortured by our consciences at the thought that we are being selfish, even when we know that we must be if we are to survive the selfishness of others; some of us never overcome the instictive repulsion at selfishness that is really the only goodness to be found in men, one found only rarely and almost everywhere scorned and degraded.

The two people in my life I have always loved without hesitation or doubt are simply the two people in whom selfishness has always seemed weakest to me -- uncannily weak, really. They alone in my entire life have seemed worth laying down my own life for. The strongest instinct I have is this need to defend what is good: it keeps me awake at night when nothing else would, it drives me forward always and makes me feel ashamed when I fail those people.
