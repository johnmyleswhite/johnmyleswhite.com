Sociology, properly conducted, is to psychology what the Ideal Gas Law is to Newtonian mechanics: the point at which individual variability can be discarded because its very randomness cancels out in aggregate.

Where this fails, we should consider how it is that one individual could be so deviant from the norm that he affected massive changes.
