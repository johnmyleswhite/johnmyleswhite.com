Happiness is built on what you do not see; the hypocrisy of virtue is a blanket that protects one against the cold of this brutal, selfish, Darwinian universe with the warmth of self-deception. Only the chronically melancholy see things as they really are, but what a price for knowledge to live with frequent bouts of misery! And it is useless knowledge you gain thereby, since the happy cannot be taught it and even if they were to be taught all you would do thereby is take their happiness away from them, rather than make them virtuous.
