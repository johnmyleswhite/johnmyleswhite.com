One hears a great deal of talk about the innocence of children, all of it nonsense. Children are plainly more selfish and crueler than adults. But it is because of this very plainness, this utter absence of deception, that the mistake is made: a child's inability to be a hypocrite, the lack of all subtlety in his attempts at manipulation, are seen as proofs of his innocence. And perhaps this is a sort of innocence -- perhaps it is even the only kind left to us any longer: to be open about our selfishness and to refuse to pass ourselves off as something else -- to not feign a type of virtue we do not possess.
