The last two weeks have been full of changes for me. For those who've been asking about what's next, I thought I'd write up a quick summary of all the news.

(1) I successfully defended my thesis this past Monday. Completing a Ph.D. has been a massive undertaking for the past five years, and it's a major relief to be done. From now on I'll be (perhaps undeservedly) making airline and restaurant reservations under the name Dr. White.

(2) As announced last week, I'll be one of [the residents at Hacker School this summer](https://www.hackerschool.com/residents). The list of other residents is pretty amazing, and I'm really looking forward to meeting the students.

(3) In addition to my residency at Hacker School, I'll be a temporary postdoc in the applied math department at MIT, where I'll be working on [Julia](http://julialang.org) full-time. Expect to see lots of work on building up the core data analysis infrastructure.

(4) As of today I've accepted an offer to join Facebook's Data Science team in the fall. I'll be moving out to the Bay Area in November.

That's all so far.
