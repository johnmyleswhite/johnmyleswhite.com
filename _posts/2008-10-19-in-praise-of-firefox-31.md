As part of my current strategy for delaying my return to the ongoing growing pains of learning probability theory, I just installed the most recent best of Firefox 3.1. Its speed really is amazing, so I would recommend it to anyone who can afford to risk having their browser crash once in a while. It renders most of the pages I frequent substantially faster than Firefox 3.0.
