Arnold Kling has just written [an interesting response](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/02/ross_douthat_on.html) to Ross Douthat's piece in The Atlantic on [Liberaltarianism](http://rossdouthat.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/02/the_future_of_liberaltarianism_1.php). I agree with a great deal of what Arnold says, especially his claim that the role of libertarian thinkers in America is "to restrain the power-hungry elites in both parties."
