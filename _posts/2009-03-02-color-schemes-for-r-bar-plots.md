A recurrent source of irritation for me is the absence of a good default behavior in R for choosing the color scheme for bar plots. A stacked bar plot looks only as good as the color scheme you use. In hope of finding a usable scheme that I could settle on as a personal default, I picked two color schemes, [Sunshine over Glacier](http://kuler.adobe.com/#themeID/375930) and [Sweet Valentine](http://kuler.adobe.com/#themeID/375675), from Adobe's [Kuler](http://kuler.adobe.com) site that struck me as particularly nice for bar plots. To test them, I plotted data from [a recent Gene Expression post on moral beliefs](http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2009/02/right-wrong-is-not-about-religion.php) among different religious groups in America. You can see the results below.

What do people think of these color schemes? Also, does anyone have ideas about how to incorporate a legend that doesn't ruin the balance of this plot? At present, it's impossible to know what these graphs actually mean, but I haven't been able to figure out how to add a legend to the graphs without substantially expanding the screen area used by them.
