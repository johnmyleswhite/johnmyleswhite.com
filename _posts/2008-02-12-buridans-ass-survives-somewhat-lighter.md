<p>Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, was recently quoted as saying, in reference to market events, that "Our economic models have never been particularly successful in capturing a process driven in large part by nonrational behavior." For example, faced with a decision between two equally valued objects, subjects will often chose a different, lesser valued object to avoid making a decision between the two more similar ones (Tversky and Shafir, 1992).</p>
