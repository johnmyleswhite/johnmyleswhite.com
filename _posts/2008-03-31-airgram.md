<blockquote>
<p>Two nice things about the air:<br />
It wraps itself around my love<br />
And brings her voice to me.</p>

<small>Frank Herbert : The Poetry of Frank Herbert -- Songs of Muad'Dib : Airgram</small>
</blockquote>

For my love: something to remember on nights when loneliness surrounds you as profoundly as midnight's darkness.
