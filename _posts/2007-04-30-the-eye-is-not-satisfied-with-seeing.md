These sorts of people really horrify me: they are our nation's our internal terrorists, wiping all that is best in our lives mercilessly and relentlessly because they are utterly sure of the righteousness of their beliefs.

Truly, all goodness demands that one be able to stop, clear one's head of one's thoughts and reconsider things from first principles. Such singleminded people as these women go far in this world because they never pause to reconsider anything and never doubt: such fanaticism is a very productive habit and its primary product is a dull, arrogant, ugly stupidity -- with a slight admixture of inescapable misery. The horrors of consumerism are to be blamed upon such women as these, those monsters who everyone envies and yet admires.

And once again, the antidote to America's horrors would be simply to appreciate the words of the most neglected part of that Bible Americans profess so much love for: Ecclesiastes.

<blockquote>
<p>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>

<small>The Holy Bible : King James Version : Ecclesiastes : I, 14</small>
</blockquote>
