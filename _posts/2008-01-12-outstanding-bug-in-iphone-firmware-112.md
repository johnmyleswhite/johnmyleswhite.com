One of my main frustrations with the 1.1.2 firmware on the iPhone is that the ability to select from multiple e-mail addresses for a single contact while composing a message is an illusion: the e-mail is always sent to the e-mail currently highlighted when you view the contact regardless of other attempts to override this. Possibly, though I have not confirmed this, the selected e-mail address is reset during synchronization with Address Book.
