Being a drummer, a programmer and a fan of statistical analysis, [this post](http://musicmachinery.com/2009/03/02/in-search-of-the-click-track/) on the (unnaturally) perfect timing of drum parts recorded to a click track was a real delight to me.

Of course, many claims in the post are odd: it seems hard to imagine that a person recorded the drums for Britney Spears. And it seems as likely that some of the drum parts discussed were edited after the recording to make them line up with a click better.

Still, it's a great experiment. What would be really nice is a time series plot averaging over top ten songs from each year. Maybe I'll get to work on that tonight before bed.
