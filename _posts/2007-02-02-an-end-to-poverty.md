Every time that I see someone talk about putting an end to poverty, I feel that the idea is not all that far removed from someone proposing to put an end to the ravishes of human sexuality "so the next generation will be born in a world free from this evil". Ending poverty is not quite such a blatant impossiblity, but it seems almost equally hopeless.
