I'd like to publicly apologize to anyone that follows me on Twitter and saw the argument I started with two people yesterday morning. While I still believe that the people on the other side of the argument had behaved inappropriately enough that someone needed to confront them, my actual reaction was completely counter-productive and represented exactly the sort of adversarial behavior that never improves a bad situation. I'll do my best not to repeat that mistake in the future.
