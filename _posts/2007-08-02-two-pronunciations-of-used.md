Today, while listening to the radio, I heard a strange pronunciation of the word "used", which, upon consideration, seems to have struck me as odd because, in my own use of English, there are two separate pronunciations for this one word (or at least this ostensibly one word) that are alternatingly used based on the grammatical context of the sentence. The other speaker, not making such a distinction, sounded unnatural to me.

To be precise, in my dialect of English, the past participle of the word "use" in its traditional semantic sense is pronounced as if it were "yoozd" with two voiced consonants, while the word "used" as a part of the periphrastic imperfect tense built around "used to" is pronounced as "yoost" with two voiceless consonants.

This leaves me with three questions:

* Is this pattern consistent for other speakers? Or is it purely a product of my own upbringing?
* If the pattern is widespread, is this an example of a pure effect of sandhi (conditioned by the "t" of "to" that follows "used" in the periphrastic) or of something more -- a change in pronunciation occuring only in certain grammatical contexts and not in others?
* Was the speaker on the radio's pronunciation characteristic of another dialect of English, or simply an example of hypercorrection?
