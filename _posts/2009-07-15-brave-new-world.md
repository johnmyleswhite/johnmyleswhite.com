I am sitting on a NJ Transit train en route from Princeton to New York for a seminar on fMRI statistical analysis. As I travel, I'm corresponding in real time with my best friend, who lives in Madrid. We're making plans for my trip there next week. And alI I can think about is how much technology has improved our lives.
