Cause to be grateful: Washington is now [the second state to allow its citizens the right to suicide](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/us/05suicide.html?_r=1&ref=us).

I think we are finally moving away from the moral prohibition of suicide that Christianity forced upon humanity as a countermeasure after having given humans every reason to wish to die.
