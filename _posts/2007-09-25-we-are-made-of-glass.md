<blockquote>
<em>Different types of dangerous lives</em>.-- You have no idea what you are living through; you rush through life as if you were drunk and now and then fall down some staircase. But thanks to your drunkenness you never break a limb: your muscles are too relaxed and your brain too benighted for you to find the stones of these stairs as hard as we do! For us life is more dangerous: we are made of glass -- woe unto us if we merely <em>bump</em> ourselves! And all is lost if we <em>fall</em>!

<small>Friedrich Nietzsche : The Gay Science : Book III : Secion 154</small>
