<blockquote>
<p>I finally saw you for the first time in two fucking years, and I told you I was fine. You told me you had made it through the roughest patch, and you tried to make some jokes, and you asked me about my life, and you shook and drank a beer, and I held back the tears. I felt no love, just pity for what you had become.</p>

<p>What a tragic life we've built.</p>

<p>"Bad things happen," you said as I walked you to the porch and faced you through the frigid Boston night. You hugged me as I stood and told me I was a good boy.</p>

<p>"Bad things happen," I whispered back, and I said I was doing fine, and I walked away, and it was so cold that the tears froze to my face.</p>

Only recently has this song begun to strike me as deeply as it does now, though no specific event in my life lately could be fairly said to be responsible for the change. Perhaps only the tenor of my days lately and the thoughts that come with it could be the cause -- the reason for this recurrent thought and its accompaniment and even harmonization at a minor third by the unfaltering certainty that the tragedy of our lives is almost always of our own construction.

What a tragic life we've built.
