Are there any studies out there that consider what links exist between variations in individual neurochemistry and neuroanatomy (examples being variation in seratonin receptors or malformation of the frontal lobe) and higher level personality traits like intelligence, introversion, nervousness, sociability -- in short, any studies out there giving us a sort of modern Galenic theory of humors built not upon the flowing of bile and other fluids, but upon the production, reception and reuptake of neurotransmitters within the brain?

I, personally, find myself considering the topic constantly, so I am forced to wonder why I am unaware of any such studies. Are there none? If there truly are none, why not? Because of technical hurdles involved with testing for gene variation or neurochemical variation in living humans? Or because of ethical doubts about such research's implications? Is this really such an unpleasant topic? Does no one want to admit the sort of things that we all know already: that, for example, the highest levels of intelligence correlate strongly with certain personality traits like introversion and awkwardness? Or that people of high intelligence seem to suffer from depressive and melancholic personalities more than others? Are these correlations real? And are the variations in personalities attributable to variations in brain chemistry and anatomy?
