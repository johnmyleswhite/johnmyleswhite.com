Mathematics -- and, more generally, all deductive reasoning -- provides us with certainity precisely because it does not deal with the world, with reality in the conventional sense in which one asserts that a rock is real and that goblins are not. This came as a shock to mathematicians with the discovery of consistent non-Euclidean geometries: mathematicians were astounded to find that mathematics, which had done so much to explain the physical world around us, had no necessary connection to that world. They were not simply shocked; they were disappointed as well, because they thus learned that of this world there can be no absolute knowledge, that the only absolute truth about human knowledge was precisely that there are no absolutes truths about reality, that every truth is dependent upon assumptions whose truth is simply an assumption one must make. Outside of the sphere of pure deduction, there is only probabilistic reasoning and plausible argument.
