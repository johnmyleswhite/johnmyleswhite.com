Given that the laws of my nation make me hesitant to participate in most prediction markets, I have two questions on which I would like to see odds:

* Will Hans Reiser be convicted of his ex-wife's murder?
* Will the new HD-DVD and Blu-Ray DVD formats go the way of the MiniDisc?

I have my own estimates, but I'd like to see those of others.
