Everything important in life can be learned from the following passage:

<blockquote>
<p>O reason not the need! Our basest beggars<br />
Are in the poorest thing superfluous.<br />
Allow not nature more than nature needs,<br />
Man's life is as cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady:<br />
If only to go warm were gorgeous,<br />
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,<br />
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need --<br />
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need.<br />
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,<br />
As full of grief as age, wretched in both.<br />
If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts<br />
Against their father, fool me not so much<br />
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,<br />
And let not women's weapons, water drops,<br />
Stain my man's cheeks. No, you unnatural hags!<br />
I will have such revenges on you both<br />
That all the world shall -- I will do such things --<br />
What they are, yet I know not; but they shall be<br />
The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep.<br />
No, I'll not weep.<br />
I have full cause of weeping, but this heart<br />
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,<br />
Or ere I'll weep. O Fool, I shall go mad!</p>

<small>William Shakespeare : King Lear : II, iv, 263-285</small>
