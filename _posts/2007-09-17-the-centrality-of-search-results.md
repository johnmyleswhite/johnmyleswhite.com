As far as I am concerned, any information on the web that does not come up in the top ten results on Google when I search for it might as well not exist at all. If your product has name X and feature Y, any search for the phrase "X Y" should return as the top result a page on your website summarizing feature Y of product X. If you do not have such a page, do not even bother adding feature Y to your product.
