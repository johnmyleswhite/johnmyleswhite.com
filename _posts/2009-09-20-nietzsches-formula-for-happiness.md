<blockquote>
<p>My formula for happiness: a Yes, a No, a straight line, a goal.</p>

<small>Friedrich Nietzsche : Twilight of the Idols : Maxims and Arrows : 44</small>
</blockquote>

It amazes me that nearly all of Nietzsche's philosophy is implicit in this single maxim, which is plainly a statement of the motive that singularly defined his personality. What is the madman of The Gay Science's fear when he says, "what were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun?," save precisely that the death of God is also the death of all purpose for human existence? What is the Overman but the goal that Nietzsche offers humanity as a replacement for a dead God's approval?
