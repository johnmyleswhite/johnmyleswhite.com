There is a very interesting paper in [the February 2009 issue of the Quarterly Journal of Economics](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/toc/qjec/124/1) on ["Performance Pay and Wage Inequality"](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/qjec.2009.124.1.1). It's fascinating to think that 21% of the rise in wage inequality since 1980 might be attributable to increased use of performance pay schemes.
