One of the great ironies of philosophical debates is that almost every line of writing that begins with the words "empty rhetoric" is itself an example of "empty rhetoric": Jefferson called Plato a sophist; I think Jefferson a sophist; someone will one day think me a sophist. And so on it goes, *ad infinitum*.

Outside of mathematics, everything written by human beings is empty rhetoric so long as you do not see the details that have been implicitly assumed by the author, but this does not preclude the fact that some writers have respect for the laws of logic and others do not.
