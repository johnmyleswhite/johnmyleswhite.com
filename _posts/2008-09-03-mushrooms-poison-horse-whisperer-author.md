At the risk of sounding even colder than I usually do, I would like to ask if I am the only one surprised by this story's details. I vividly remember being told literally hundreds of times as a small child that I should never eat anything that I found in the wild. I am therefore surprised that a famous novelist seems not to have ever learned a lesson I understood when I was five years old. Are British children encouraged to eat unidentified plant life?
