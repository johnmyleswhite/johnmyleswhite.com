It occurred to me today that the reason I find attempts to "beat Vegas" so odd is that I am nearly certain that, if you are smart enough to actually beat Vegas and yet you are not spending your time trying to beat Wall Street instead, you must be stupid.

Consider this my proof by contradiction that no one ever beats Vegas.
