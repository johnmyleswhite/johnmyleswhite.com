<p>I am among the best and worst of us. And aren't we all trying to put this and that in first place? In first place even when we don't believe in us. We look right over the shoulder of a friend (a weakness so self-contained) to wage a war that has no standing, no lasting value -- and brutal repercussions that will leave a man alone. It's hard to negate what you've known, putting yourself out on the line, even when we don't believe in us. This life has a hold of me, to a place where I dare not go. Reinstate.</p>
