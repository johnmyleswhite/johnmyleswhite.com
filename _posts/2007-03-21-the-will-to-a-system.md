Like the blind men of legend who each held onto a different part of an elephant, each of us sees but a small part of the world and understands only little of that small amount he sees. The nature of life, though, compels man to make sense of the world, and so he must assume that there is a single reality behind these isolated impressions and that all his impressions are but intimations of this single, coherent reality. But he goes too far in this and defiles his experiences by combining them into a system of thought, enforcing unity where there is discord and filling in what he has not seen with what the repeated image of what he has seen. Rather than build a system upon simple -- and simplistic -- axioms, the philosopher does better to put down only what he has seen as faithfully as he can, so as to provide generations to come with the small insights and unpretentious laws which he has been able to infer, for it is within no one's ability to construct a theory of everything.
