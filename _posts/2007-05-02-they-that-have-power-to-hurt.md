<blockquote>
<p>They that have power to hurt, and will do none,<br />
That do not do the thing they most do show,<br />
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,<br />
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;<br />
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,<br />
And husband nature's riches from expense;<br />
They are the lords and owners of their faces,<br />
Others, but stewards of their excellence.<br />
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,<br />
Though to itself, it only live and die,<br />
But if that flower with base infection meet,<br />
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:<br />
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;<br />
Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.</p>

<small>William Shakespeare : Sonnets : Sonnet 94</small>

One of the best definitions of my ideal of goodness, an ideal utterly at odds with contemporary sensibilities.
