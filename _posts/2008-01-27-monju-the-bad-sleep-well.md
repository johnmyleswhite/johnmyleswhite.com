It is remarkable how much the story of the cover-up of the events that occurred after the failure of the Monju nuclear reactor reminds me of the plot of Kurosawa's "The Bad Sleep Well." The verisimiltude hereby given to Kurosawa's tale implies something about the Japanese.

That said, the video, which can be seen at [Wikileaks](http://wikileaks.org/wiki/The_Monju_nuclear_reactor_leak) does not strike me as particularly scandalous. The thin layer of what I presume is salt over everything is a strange sight, but not especially fearsome.
