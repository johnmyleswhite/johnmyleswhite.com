As some of you may know already, I'm co-organizing an upcoming conference called DataGotham that's taking place in September. To help spread the word about DataGotham, I'm cross-posting the most recent announcement below:

> We'd like to let you know about DataGotham: a celebration of New York City's data community!
> 
> <http://datagotham.com>
> 
> This is an event run by Drew Conway, Hilary Mason, Mike Dewar and John Myles White that will bring together professionals from finance to fashion and from startups to the Fortune 500. This day-and-a-half event will consist of intense discussion, networking, and sharing of wisdom, and will take place September 13th-14th at NYU Stern.
> 
> We also have four tutorials running on the afternoon of the 13th, followed by cocktails and The Great Data Extravaganza Show at the Tribeca Rooftop that evening. Tickets are on sale -- we would love to see you there! 

If you'd like to attend, please see the [DataGotham website](http://datagotham.com) for more information. Since you're a reader of this fine blog, we've set up a special "Friends and Family" discount that will give you 25% off the ticket price. To get the discount, you need to use the promo code "dataGothamist".
