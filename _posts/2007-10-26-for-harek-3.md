As I've done for two years now, I'd like to thank Harek for being the best friend I could ever ask for. Even though we almost never find the time to talk anymore, I have not once doubted that our friendship is still something sacred.

<blockquote>
<p>Time flies and it's flown away with me this time. All my good intentions taken out by my absent mind. Apologies are far too small when in them arrogance stands tall, so let me throw away my pride, because I have nothing to hide. This is our fight, side by side, reaching out to make this right. No matter how small the chance or how great the task I will try; no matter how long the fall or what's at stake I'll aim to fly. Because you've shown me what it's like to live, nowhere to look but up, nothing to hold back, everything to give. Your friendship means the world to me. Maybe we'll never lose this. Maybe time will make us into memories, but one thing is true, in the end we'll be glad we gave all we had.</p>
