From Pew Research, here's a gem for those interested in real world examples of risk aversion:[there are two people who prefer a secure job that pays less well for every one person who prefers a higher salary with the risk of job loss.](http://pewresearch.org/databank/dailynumber/?NumberID=854) Of course, you'd want to know what all of these people assume the ratio of risk of job less to salary increase is to really use this, but it's promising.
