This morning, as I walked to work, I sneezed. A man, walking at least ten feet ahead of me within the crowd that fills 8th Avenue between 41st and 42nd Street in the early morning rush to get to work, paused, turned around and said, "bless you," to me.

Such small acts of kindness and decency restore my hope in humanity, though they are rare in a life that seems almost always nasty, brutish and short. They seem like stars against the night's blackness and I had to think of Wilde's words in De Profundis:

<blockquote>
<p>I have never said one single word to him about what he did. I do not know to the present moment whether he is aware that I was even conscious of his action. It is not a thing for which one can render formal thanks in formal words.</p>

<small>Oscar Wilde : De Profundis</small>
