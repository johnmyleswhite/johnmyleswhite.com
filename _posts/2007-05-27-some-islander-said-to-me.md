I've meant to cite the following few passages from Houellebecq for a while now as they strike me as utterly true statements that are virtually never admitted to in public.

<blockquote>
<p>When sexuality disappears, it's the body of the other that appears, as a vaguely hostile presence; the sounds, movements, and smells; even the presence of this body that you can no longer touch, nor sanctify through touch, becomes gradually oppressive.</p>

<small>Michel Houellebecq : The Possibility Of An Island : Daniel1, 6</small>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>According to her, this would last another four or five years before we could admit that the passage from love to friendship, i.e., from a strong feeling to a weak one, was patently the prelude to the disappearance of all feeling -- on the historical level, I mean, for on the individual one, indifference was by far the most favorable situation: once love had broken down, it was generally not transformed into indifference, and even less frequently into friendship.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>To sum up, like all clowns since the dawn of time, I was a sort of *collaborator*. I spared the world from painful and useless revolutions -- since the root of all evil was biological, and independent of any imaginable social transformation; I established clarity, I forbade action, I eradicated hope; my balance sheet was mixed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally I could have certainly formulated some objections, for example the fact that nonpossessive love only seemed conceivable if you yourself lived in an atmosphere saturated with delights, from which all fear was absent, particularly fear of abandonment and death, and that it implied at the very least, and among other things, eternity; in short the conditions for it were not reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Love is simple to define, but it seldom happens -- in the series of beings. Through these dogs we pay homage to love, and to its possibility. What is a dog but a machine for loving? You introduce him to a human being, giving him the mission to love -- and however ugly, perverse, deformed, or stupid this human being might be, the dog loves him. This characteristic was so surprising, so striking for the humans of the previous race that most of them -- all testimonies agree on this point -- came to love the dog back. The dog was therefore a machine for loving, which could also train others to love -- its efficiency, however, remained limited to dogs, and never extended to other men.</p>
