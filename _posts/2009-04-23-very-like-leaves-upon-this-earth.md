<blockquote>
<p>Men come and go as leaves year by year upon the trees. Those of autumn the wind sheds upon the ground, but when spring returns the forest buds forth with fresh vines. Even so is it with the generations of mankind, the new spring up as the old are passing away.</p>

<small>Homer : The Iliad : Book VI : Samuel Butler Translation</small>
