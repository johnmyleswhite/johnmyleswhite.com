<blockquote>
<p>So, to paraphrase a real conservative, Ronald Reagan: I haven't left the Republican Party. It left me.</p>

<small>Christopher Buckley : <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2008-10-14/sorry-dad-i-was-fired/">Sorry, Dad, I Was Fired</a></small>
</blockquote>

From the end of a piece by Christopher Buckley in which he explains his endorsement of Barack Obama and his subsequent resignation from the National Review, the conservative magazine that his father founded.

The piece as a whole strikes me as the perfect companion to David Mamet's ["Why I Am No Longer a 'Brain Dead Liberal'."](http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-03-11/news/why-i-am-no-longer-a-brain-dead-liberal/)
